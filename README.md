# CRACK-PROPERTY-ANALYSIS-USING-IMAGE-PROCESSING

Structures that have stood for a long time and is still operational now for several years 
are referred to be aging structures. The crack is an early signal of an aging structure 
along with its analysis of measure, can be determine the life prediction of an structure. 
Crack Monitoring is usually done by visual inspection, which can occasionally result in 
inconsistent data. The Authors have worked to extract the length, width with area and 
depth of the crack from the image. The Authors have put forth an algorithm for 
measuring and analysing cracks that make use of bilateral filtering, connectedcomponent labelling, and thresholding, among other image processing methods. The 
main goal of this development is to reduce human error while spotting cracks in diverse 
structures. For the most accurate findings, analysis of the collected data was done by 
removing the background noise to accurately measure the crack’s length and width. To 
check the viability of this algorithms, authors performed experiment using pictures of 
genuine concrete surface used to examine crack properties. 

In recent years we have witnessed a rise in interest in the measurement of crack on concrete 
structures. Important indicators of the structural integrity and health of a concrete element 
include the creation, breadth, and propagation of cracks. Traditionally, crack inspection is done 
by specialists visually, using a crack scale and a loupe. Methods of automatic crack detection 
were done conventionally through image processing [ 4] 
Important details regarding a concrete block's durability and reasons of degradation can be 
learned via crack width analysis. Manual inspection, however, is frequently time-consuming, 
making quantitative analysis impractical. As a result, the significance of applying image 
processing for visual assessment has continuously grown. 
Related works in automatic crack detection using image processing have been reported in [2-
4]. Also, in [5,6], proposed an image processing technique for crack detection using percolation 
model which considers the relationship with neighbouring pixels. The region and border of 
images can now be directly and naturally expressed using image segmentation techniques 
based on the level set. As a result, these techniques are more in line with the notion of picture 
segmentation. Additionally, level set results do not require post-processing such as region 
merging and edge joining[7]. 
Non-destructive testing is an inspection technique that allows materials or components to be 
examined without changing their original shapes or functions. It also refers to all inspection 
methods to examine a product's properties, conditions, and internal structures without 
disassembling or destroying it. Non-destructive testing is an inspection technique related to the 
measurement of crack depth in structures. Non-destructive testing methods include 
radiographic testing(RT), ultrasonic testing (UT), magnetic practice testing (MT), penetrant 
testing (PT), eddy current testing (ET), leak testing (LT), and infrared thermography (IRT), 
and so on, and the demand is fast growing with the development of high-value-added industries 
[8]. 
The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm which will help in the inspection and 
maintenance of concrete surfaces that extract information like measurement of crack length 
and width. This work targets to design an measurement algorithm that uses different image 
processing techniques. Engineers and inspectors' manual work will be replaced by automated 
work in the hopes that this will produce results that are consistent. The system will analyse the 
data and present the findings. Engineers and inspectors of old buildings will gain a lot from 
this study because automation will replace their manual labour and produce correct results 
quickly. 


In this work, the method of determining crack length width and area using the intensity values 
is successfully validated and verified by implementing the algorithm in 25+ images. 
Additionally we have successfully implemented an image-based non contact inspection method 
by developing an GUI in which user can get details within few clicks. 
Reletively the traditional methods, sketching the crack pattern, and using crack guages, the 
main advantage of this algorithm are significant increase in: speed, efficiency, information, and 
reliability as automatic image processing is applied. 
The drawback of this algorithm is, it will only suitable for laboratory test monitoring because 
the spatial resolution required for large structures, such as bridges and dams, does not allow 
low cost commercial cameras. And sometimes some surfaces are identified wrongly as cracks. 
Future scope 
The performed algorithm can replace the traditional method of measuring crack length width 
and area of the crack by hand using crack guages and through that information taken from it is 
transformed into drawing sheets, which is also labor-intensive and may be less accurate. 
Future work needs focus on increasing the crack width detecting algorithm's precision and 
lowering false-negative errors. For further improvement of this algorithm, calibration can be 
done manually for different cases and for various distances between camera and the crack.
